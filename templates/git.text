If you're trying to push your local project to GitHub, here's the correct way:
Initialize git (if not done):

bash
Copy
Edit
git init
Add your files:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
Commit the changes:

bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Add the remote repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git remote add origin https://github.com/Siva1345772/yt-downloader.git
Push your changes:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push -u origin main
If your branch is master, replace main with master.

Would you like help confirming your branch name or fixing any push errors next?

ChatGPT said:
The error:

lua
Copy
Edit
error: src refspec main does not match any
means that Git can't find a local branch named main. This usually happens when:

You haven't made any commits yet, or

Your current branch is named something else (like master), not main.

✅ To Fix This:
Step 1: Check your branch
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
git branch
If it shows * master, then you're on the master branch, not main.

Step 2: Make sure you've committed something
If you haven’t committed yet, Git has nothing to push. You need to:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Step 3: Push using the correct branch name
If you're on master, push like this:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push -u origin master
If you're on main, then use:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push -u origin main
Would you like help renaming your branch to main, or are you okay using master?
